<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>FOS - Static Region</strong> plug-in has been created to honour the "everything refreshable" principle. The plug-in allows you to refresh the static content client-side or server-side. It also supports shortcuts, Lazy Loading, Lazy Refreshing, and showing a loading spinner and mask.

    Why would I want to refresh static content when it is static content after all? ...the reason is in the situations when you have used substitutions in your content.
